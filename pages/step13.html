    <h1>Gravitation</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      Gravitation describes the attraction between masses.
      At this stage, gravity is treated as a force acting at a distance.
      This model works extremely well for most everyday and planetary situations.
      However, this is not the complete picture. The deeper nature of gravity
      will be revisited later.

  <div id="universal-law">
    <h3>Universal Law of Gravitation</h3>
    <p>
      Every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional
      to the product of their masses and inversely proportional
      to the square of the distance between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This law explains phenomena ranging from falling objects
      to the motion of planets.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="gravitational-field">
    <h3>Gravitational Field</h3>
    <p>
      A gravitational field represents the influence a mass exerts
      on the space around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows gravitational effects to be described without
      requiring direct contact between objects.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="acc-due-gravity">
    <h3>Acceleration Due to Gravity</h3>
    <p>
      Near the surface of Earth, all objects experience nearly
      the same gravitational acceleration, regardless of mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      This explains why heavy and light objects fall together
      when air resistance is negligible.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="variation-g">
    <h3>Variation of g</h3>
    <p>
      The value of gravitational acceleration changes with altitude,
      depth, and latitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      These variations arise due to Earth's shape, rotation,
      and distance from its center.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="orbits">
    <h3>Orbital Motion</h3>
    <p>
      Orbital motion occurs when gravitational attraction provides
      the necessary centripetal force for circular or elliptical motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satellites remain in orbit by continuously falling around Earth.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="what-gravity-really">
    <h3>Is Gravity Really a Force?</h3>
    <p>
      In classical physics, gravity is treated as a force.
      This approximation is extremely successful and practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, modern physics describes gravity not as a force,
      but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
      This deeper interpretation will be explored later.
