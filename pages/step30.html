  <div id="basic-phenomenon">
    <h3>Basic Phenomenon</h3>
    <p>
      The photoelectric effect refers to the emission of electrons from a metal surface
      when light of sufficiently high frequency falls on it. When light strikes the surface,
      electrons are ejected almost instantaneously if certain conditions are met.
      This behavior is surprising because increasing light intensity does not guarantee
      electron emission unless the frequency is high enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect reveals that light interacts with matter in discrete energy packets
      rather than as a continuous wave. This simple observation directly contradicts
      classical expectations and signals the need for a new physical framework.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="experimental-observations">
    <h3>Key Experimental Observations</h3>
    <p>
      Experiments showed three crucial facts. First, below a certain frequency,
      no electrons are emitted regardless of light intensity.
      Second, the kinetic energy of emitted electrons depends only on frequency,
      not intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, electron emission occurs without measurable time delay.
      These results were completely incompatible with wave theory,
      which predicted gradual energy accumulation and delayed emission.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="classical-failure">
    <h3>Failure of Classical Wave Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Classical wave theory treats light energy as spread uniformly across the wavefront.
      According to this view, increasing intensity should increase electron energy,
      and low-frequency light should eventually eject electrons given enough time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experiments contradicted both predictions.
      The failure was fundamental, not technical.
      It showed that light does not deliver energy continuously,
      forcing physicists to abandon classical assumptions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="einstein-explanation">
    <h3>Einstein’s Explanation</h3>
    <p>
      Einstein proposed that light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons.
      Each photon carries energy proportional to its frequency.
      An electron absorbs energy from a single photon in a one-to-one interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the photon’s energy exceeds the work function of the metal,
      the electron escapes immediately.
      This explanation perfectly matched experimental data
      and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="threshold-frequency">
    <h3>Threshold Frequency</h3>
    <p>
      The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of light required
      to eject electrons from a particular metal surface.
      Below this frequency, no electrons are emitted regardless of intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This property depends on the metal’s work function
      and reflects the binding energy of electrons in the material.
      It highlights the particle nature of light.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="photoelectric-equation">
    <h3>Photoelectric Equation</h3>
    <p>
      The photoelectric equation relates photon energy
      to the work function and kinetic energy of emitted electrons.
      It expresses energy conservation in the photon-electron interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation mathematically formalized the quantum view of light
      and linked frequency directly to measurable electron energies.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="significance">
    <h3>Scientific Significance</h3>
    <p>
      The photoelectric effect provided undeniable proof
      that light has particle-like properties.
      It marked a turning point in physics,
      forcing acceptance of quantum theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond theory, it enabled technologies such as photo sensors,
      solar cells, and imaging devices.
      It fundamentally changed how humanity understands radiation and matter.
