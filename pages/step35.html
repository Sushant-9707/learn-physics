    <h1>Astrophysics & Cosmology</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      Astrophysics and cosmology apply all of physics to the universe itself.
      From quantum mechanics to relativity, from nuclear reactions to gravity,
      this field asks the largest possible questions:
      what is the universe made of, how did it begin, how does it evolve,
      and why does it exist in the form we observe.

<div id="scales">
  <h3>From Particles to the Cosmos</h3>
  <p>
    Everything explored so far, from mechanics to quantum physics, is not separate.
    The universe does not switch rulebooks at different scales. The same laws
    governing electrons also shape stars and galaxies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quantum mechanics explains atomic structure and radiation.
    Nuclear physics explains how energy is released inside stars.
    Relativity explains how space, time, and gravity behave on cosmic scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    Astrophysics exists because the universe uses all of physics at once.
    It is not a new theory, but the application of everything you already learned
    to the largest laboratory that exists: the cosmos itself.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="stars">
  <h3>Stars and Stellar Evolution</h3>
  <p>
    Stars are massive nuclear reactors held together by gravity.
    Their existence is a balance between gravitational collapse and
    outward pressure produced by nuclear fusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside stellar cores, hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, releasing energy
    through mass–energy equivalence. This process powers starlight and heat.
  </p>
  <p>
    As stars evolve, their internal reactions change. Small stars end quietly.
    Massive stars explode as supernovae, creating heavy elements essential for
    planets, chemistry, and life.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="galaxies">
  <h3>Galaxies and Large Scale Structure</h3>
  <p>
    Galaxies are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound by gravity.
    They are not randomly distributed, but arranged in filaments and clusters.
  </p>
  <p>
    This large scale structure emerges from tiny density fluctuations in the early universe,
    amplified over billions of years by gravitational attraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding galaxies requires mechanics, electromagnetism,
    nuclear physics, and relativity working together.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="expansion">
  <h3>Expanding Universe</h3>
  <p>
    Observations show that distant galaxies are moving away from us.
    The farther they are, the faster they recede.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not because galaxies are flying through space,
    but because space itself is expanding.
    Distances grow as spacetime stretches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Expansion is a direct prediction of general relativity
    and a cornerstone of modern cosmology.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="bigbang">
  <h3>The Big Bang Model</h3>
  <p>
    The Big Bang is not an explosion in space.
    It is the expansion of space itself from an extremely hot, dense state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Early in the universe, conditions were so extreme that
    matter, radiation, and spacetime behaved differently than today.
    As the universe expanded and cooled, particles formed,
    nuclei assembled, atoms emerged, and structures grew.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evidence includes cosmic microwave background radiation,
    elemental abundances, and large scale structure.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="dark">
  <h3>Dark Matter and Dark Energy</h3>
  <p>
    Observations show that visible matter accounts for only a small fraction
    of the universe’s total content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dark matter interacts gravitationally but not electromagnetically,
    shaping galaxies and clusters.
    Dark energy drives accelerated expansion of the universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their true nature remains unknown, marking the edge of current knowledge.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="relativity-cosmos">
  <h3>Relativity in the Universe</h3>
  <p>
    General relativity governs the structure and evolution of the universe.
    It predicts black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmic expansion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Light bends near massive objects.
    Time flows differently in strong gravitational fields.
    Spacetime geometry determines motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The universe is not a static stage.
    It is dynamic, curved, and responsive to energy and matter.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="curiosity">
  <h3>The Real Engine of Human Progress</h3>
  <p>
    Humans were never the strongest species.
    We were not the fastest, the sharpest, or the toughest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Intelligence alone does not explain progress.
    Dolphins, octopuses, ravens, and many other species display remarkable intelligence.
    Yet they did not build telescopes, equations, or spacecraft.
  </p>
  <p>
    What kept humans moving forward was something stranger and more powerful.
    Curiosity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The relentless urge to ask three questions:
    what is this,
    why does it behave this way,
    and how does it work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Curiosity turns confusion into exploration,
    ignorance into knowledge,
    and observation into understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Physics exists because humans refused to stop asking.
    So never stop.
    Keep questioning.
    Keep learning.
    Keep growing.
  </p>
