    <h1>Kinetic Theory of Gases</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      The kinetic theory of gases explains macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature
      by analyzing the microscopic motion of gas molecules.
      It connects everyday observations with molecular-level physics.

  <div id="assumptions">
    <h3>Assumptions of Kinetic Theory</h3>
    <p>
      The kinetic theory assumes that gases consist of a very large number of tiny particles
      moving randomly in all directions. These particles are treated as point masses with
      negligible volume compared to the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collisions between molecules and container walls are assumed to be perfectly elastic,
      meaning no energy is lost during collisions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="pressure-origin">
    <h3>Origin of Pressure</h3>
    <p>
      Gas pressure arises due to repeated collisions of gas molecules with the walls of a container.
      Each collision transfers momentum to the wall, producing a force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collective effect of billions of such collisions per second results in measurable pressure.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="temperature-meaning">
    <h3>Meaning of Temperature</h3>
    <p>
      Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of gas molecules.
      Higher temperature means molecules move faster on average.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not depend on the size of the gas sample but on molecular motion.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="rms-speed">
    <h3>RMS Speed of Molecules</h3>
    <p>
      Root Mean Square (RMS) speed represents the effective average speed of gas molecules.
      It is directly related to temperature and inversely related to molecular mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lighter molecules move faster than heavier ones at the same temperature.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="degrees-freedom">
    <h3>Degrees of Freedom</h3>
    <p>
      Degrees of freedom refer to the independent ways in which a molecule can store energy,
      such as translational, rotational, and vibrational motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number depends on the molecular structure of the gas.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="equipartition">
    <h3>Law of Equipartition of Energy</h3>
    <p>
      This law states that energy is equally distributed among all available degrees of freedom
      of a system in thermal equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      It helps predict internal energy and heat capacity of gases.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="limitations">
    <h3>Limitations of the Theory</h3>
    <p>
      The kinetic theory works well for ideal gases but fails at high pressures or low temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intermolecular forces and molecular size become significant in real gases.
    </p>
