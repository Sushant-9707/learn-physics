    <h1>Particle Physics</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      Particle physics studies the most fundamental building blocks of matter and the
      forces through which they interact. It asks what everything is made of at the
      deepest level and why the universe has the structure it does.
      This field replaces solid objects with quantum fields and interactions.

<div id="fundamental">
  <h3>What Are Fundamental Particles</h3>
  <p>
    Fundamental particles are particles that are not known to be made of anything smaller.
    Unlike atoms or protons, they show no internal structure in experiments.
  </p>
  <p>
    At everyday scales, matter looks continuous and solid.
    At atomic scales, matter breaks into atoms and electrons.
    At subatomic scales, even protons and neutrons break into smaller components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Particle physics goes one level deeper and asks which particles cannot be divided further.
    These particles are treated as point-like, meaning they have no measurable size.
  </p>
  <p>
    All known matter and forces can be described using a small set of such particles
    interacting through fundamental forces.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="fermions">
  <h3>Fermions and Matter Particles</h3>
  <p>
    Fermions are particles that make up matter.
    They follow the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two identical fermions
    can occupy the same quantum state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fermions are divided into quarks and leptons.
    Quarks combine to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons.
    Leptons include electrons and neutrinos.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are three generations of fermions.
    Each generation is heavier than the previous one,
    but only the first generation forms ordinary matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The heavier generations exist briefly in high-energy environments
    and decay into lighter particles.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="bosons">
  <h3>Force Carrier Particles</h3>
  <p>
    Bosons are particles responsible for mediating forces.
    Unlike fermions, multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state.
  </p>
  <p>
    The photon mediates the electromagnetic force.
    Gluons mediate the strong nuclear force.
    W and Z bosons mediate the weak nuclear force.
  </p>
  <p>
    These particles are exchanged between matter particles,
    producing interactions that appear as forces at larger scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forces are not continuous pulls.
    They are quantum interactions involving particle exchange.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="standard-model">
  <h3>The Standard Model</h3>
  <p>
    The Standard Model is the theoretical framework describing all known
    fundamental particles and three of the four fundamental forces.
  </p>
  <p>
    It successfully explains electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions
    using quantum field theory.
  </p>
  <p>
    The model classifies particles into fermions, gauge bosons, and the Higgs boson.
    Its predictions have been verified to extraordinary precision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite its success, the Standard Model is incomplete.
    It does not include gravity and cannot explain dark matter or dark energy.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="higgs">
  <h3>Higgs Mechanism and Higgs Boson</h3>
  <p>
    The Higgs mechanism explains why some particles have mass.
    Without it, all fundamental particles would move at the speed of light.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Higgs field exists everywhere in space.
    Particles interacting strongly with this field acquire mass.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Higgs boson is an excitation of the Higgs field.
    Its discovery in 2012 confirmed a key prediction of the Standard Model.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mass is not an intrinsic label.
    It arises from interaction with a universal field.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="interactions">
  <h3>Fundamental Interactions</h3>
  <p>
    There are four known fundamental interactions:
    gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Particle physics focuses mainly on the last three,
    which are described by quantum field theories.
  </p>
  <p>
    The strong force binds quarks together inside protons and neutrons.
    The weak force allows particles to change type, enabling radioactive decay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each interaction has its own properties, range, and strength,
    shaping the structure of matter.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="antimatter">
  <h3>Antimatter</h3>
  <p>
    For every particle, there exists a corresponding antiparticle
    with the same mass but opposite charge and quantum numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    When matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate,
    converting their mass into energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Antimatter is routinely produced in particle accelerators
    and studied in laboratories.
  </p>
  <p>
    A major mystery is why the observable universe contains far more matter
    than antimatter.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="limits">
  <h3>Limits of the Standard Model</h3>
  <p>
    Despite its accuracy, the Standard Model leaves many questions unanswered.
    It does not explain gravity or the nature of dark matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    It cannot account for the observed imbalance between matter and antimatter.
    It also treats neutrino masses in an incomplete way.
  </p>
  <p>
    These limitations suggest that the Standard Model is part of a deeper theory.
    Many proposed extensions exist, but none are confirmed yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Particle physics remains an open field,
    driven by both experimental discovery and theoretical exploration.
