    <h1>Modern Physics</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      Modern physics emerged when classical physics failed to explain
      phenomena at very small scales, very high speeds, or very high energies.
      It fundamentally changed how we understand matter, energy, space, and time,
      replacing certainty with probability and intuition with mathematics.

  <div id="failure-classical">
    <h3>Failure of Classical Physics</h3>
    <p>
      Classical physics, developed by Newton, Maxwell, and others, worked extremely well
      for everyday phenomena. However, experiments at atomic and subatomic scales
      exposed serious failures. Classical theory could not explain blackbody radiation,
      the photoelectric effect, atomic stability, or discrete spectral lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      These failures were not minor calculation errors but fundamental breakdowns
      of underlying assumptions. They revealed that nature behaves very differently
      at small scales and high speeds, forcing physicists to abandon deeply rooted ideas
      about determinism, continuity, and absolute measurement.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="quantization">
    <h3>Quantization of Energy</h3>
    <p>
      One of the first radical ideas of modern physics was that energy is not continuous.
      Instead, it is exchanged in discrete packets called quanta. This idea was introduced
      by Max Planck while explaining blackbody radiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantization means systems can only possess specific allowed energy values.
      This single concept shattered classical expectations and laid the foundation
      for quantum mechanics, fundamentally changing how energy, radiation,
      and matter are understood.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="wave-particle">
    <h3>Wave–Particle Duality</h3>
    <p>
      Modern physics revealed that entities once thought to be purely particles
      or purely waves actually exhibit both behaviors. Light, traditionally a wave,
      shows particle-like behavior in the photoelectric effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even matter, such as electrons, exhibits wave properties like interference.
      This duality does not mean objects switch identities but that classical categories
      are insufficient to describe reality at microscopic scales.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="uncertainty">
    <h3>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</h3>
    <p>
      The uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical quantities,
      such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision.
      This is not due to experimental limitations but a fundamental property of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It implies that the act of measurement influences the system,
      eliminating the classical idea of a perfectly predictable universe
      and replacing it with intrinsic uncertainty.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="atomic-models">
    <h3>Evolution of Atomic Models</h3>
    <p>
      Classical atomic models failed to explain why electrons do not spiral into the nucleus.
      Modern physics introduced quantized orbits, wavefunctions, and probability clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each model refinement reflected deeper understanding,
      moving from simple planetary analogies
      to abstract mathematical descriptions that better matched experimental results.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="relativity-overview">
    <h3>Relativity Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Einstein’s relativity redefined space and time, showing that measurements
      depend on the observer’s state of motion. Time is no longer absolute,
      and space is intertwined with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relativity becomes essential at high velocities and strong gravitational fields,
      revealing that mass and energy are interchangeable
      and that spacetime itself is dynamic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="probability">
    <h3>Role of Probability</h3>
    <p>
      Modern physics replaces deterministic predictions with probabilistic outcomes.
      Instead of exact trajectories, it provides probability distributions
      for measurement results.
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not imply ignorance but reflects how nature fundamentally operates,
      challenging classical notions of causality and certainty.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="impact">
    <h3>Impact on Technology & Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      Modern physics reshaped technology through semiconductors, lasers, nuclear energy,
      medical imaging, and quantum computing.
      Its influence extends beyond engineering into philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concepts of reality, observation, and knowledge were redefined,
      forcing humanity to accept that the universe is stranger
      than classical intuition ever imagined.
