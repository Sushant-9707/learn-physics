    <h1>Nuclear Physics</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      Nuclear physics deals with the core of atoms, where almost all mass lives and
      where energies are millions of times larger than chemical reactions.
      This is the physics of binding, decay, radiation, and reactions that power stars
      and threaten civilizations.

<div id="nucleus">
  <h3>Structure of the Nucleus</h3>
  <p>
    At the center of every atom lies the nucleus, an extremely small but incredibly dense
    region containing protons and neutrons. Almost the entire mass of an atom is packed
    into this tiny volume, while electrons occupy a comparatively vast empty space around it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Protons carry positive charge, while neutrons are electrically neutral.
    The number of protons defines the element, while the number of neutrons can vary,
    creating isotopes of the same element. Despite the strong repulsion between positively
    charged protons, the nucleus remains stable.
  </p>
  <p>
    This stability is due to the strong nuclear force, a powerful but short-range force
    that acts between nucleons. It completely overpowers electromagnetic repulsion at very
    small distances, effectively gluing the nucleus together.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="binding">
  <h3>Nuclear Binding Energy</h3>
  <p>
    Nuclear binding energy is the energy required to completely separate a nucleus
    into its individual protons and neutrons. It is a direct measure of how tightly
    the nucleus is held together.
  </p>
  <p>
    When nucleons bind together, the total mass of the nucleus is slightly less than
    the sum of the masses of the free protons and neutrons. This missing mass is called
    mass defect and is converted into energy according to E = mc².
  </p>
  <p>
    Binding energy per nucleon explains nuclear stability. Medium-mass nuclei like iron
    are the most stable, while very light and very heavy nuclei can release energy
    through fusion or fission respectively.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="radioactivity">
  <h3>Radioactivity</h3>
  <p>
    Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of particles or radiation from unstable nuclei.
    These nuclei transform into more stable configurations by releasing excess energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are three main types of radioactive emissions: alpha particles, beta particles,
    and gamma rays. Alpha particles are helium nuclei, beta particles are fast electrons
    or positrons, and gamma rays are high-energy photons.
  </p>
  <p>
    Radioactive decay is random at the level of individual atoms, but predictable
    statistically for large numbers of nuclei. This randomness is a fundamental feature
    of quantum mechanics.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="decay-law">
  <h3>Radioactive Decay Law</h3>
  <p>
    The radioactive decay law states that the rate at which nuclei decay is proportional
    to the number of undecayed nuclei present. This leads to an exponential decrease
    over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    A key concept is half-life, the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei
    in a sample to decay. Each isotope has a characteristic half-life that cannot be
    altered by physical or chemical conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Half-life allows radioactive materials to be used as clocks in archaeology,
    geology, and medicine, providing insight into processes that occur over vast timescales.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="fission">
  <h3>Nuclear Fission</h3>
  <p>
    Nuclear fission occurs when a heavy nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei,
    releasing a large amount of energy. This happens because the products have
    higher binding energy per nucleon than the original nucleus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fission can be spontaneous or induced by neutron absorption. In induced fission,
    additional neutrons are released, which can trigger further fission events,
    leading to a chain reaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Controlled chain reactions power nuclear reactors, while uncontrolled reactions
    form the basis of nuclear weapons. The same physics, vastly different outcomes.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="fusion">
  <h3>Nuclear Fusion</h3>
  <p>
    Nuclear fusion involves combining light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus.
    This process releases energy because the resulting nucleus has greater
    binding energy per nucleon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome
    electrostatic repulsion between nuclei. These conditions naturally exist
    in stars, where fusion powers stellar radiation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fusion is considered a potential future energy source because it produces
    enormous energy with minimal long-lived radioactive waste, though achieving
    controlled fusion on Earth remains a major challenge.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="applications">
  <h3>Applications of Nuclear Physics</h3>
  <p>
    Nuclear physics has applications far beyond power generation and weapons.
    In medicine, radioactive isotopes are used for imaging and cancer treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
    In industry, radiation helps inspect materials and measure thickness with
    high precision. In science, nuclear techniques reveal the age of ancient
    artifacts and geological formations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite its risks, nuclear physics remains one of the most impactful
    fields in understanding energy, matter, and the evolution of the universe.
