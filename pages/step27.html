      Geometrical optics studies light by treating it as rays that travel in straight lines.
      This approach ignores the wave nature of light and works well when the size of objects
      involved is much larger than the wavelength of light.

    <h3>Nature of Light in Geometrical Optics</h3>
    <p>
      In geometrical optics, light is modeled as rays that travel in straight lines
      until they interact with surfaces or boundaries between media.
      This model does not explain interference or diffraction,
      but it accurately describes reflection, refraction, and image formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approximation works because the wavelength of visible light
      is extremely small compared to everyday objects.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="reflection">
    <h3>Reflection of Light</h3>
    <p>
      Reflection occurs when light strikes a surface and returns to the same medium.
      The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection,
      and both angles are measured with respect to the normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflection explains mirrors, polished surfaces,
      and the formation of images without energy loss.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="refraction">
    <h3>Refraction of Light</h3>
    <p>
      Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another.
      This bending occurs because the speed of light changes between media.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refraction explains phenomena such as bending of a straw in water
      and the focusing ability of lenses.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="snell">
    <h3>Snell’s Law</h3>
    <p>
      Snell’s law mathematically relates the angles of incidence and refraction
      to the refractive indices of the two media.
      It provides a precise rule for predicting how light bends at boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      This law is fundamental to lens design, prisms, and optical devices.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="total-internal">
    <h3>Total Internal Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from a denser medium
      to a rarer medium at an angle greater than the critical angle.
      Instead of refracting, all the light reflects back.
    </p>
    <p>
      This principle is used in optical fibers,
      allowing light to travel long distances with minimal loss.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="mirrors">
    <h3>Image Formation by Mirrors</h3>
    <p>
      Plane and spherical mirrors form images based on reflection laws.
      Ray diagrams help determine image position, size, and nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concave mirrors can form real or virtual images,
      while convex mirrors always form virtual, diminished images.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="lenses">
    <h3>Image Formation by Lenses</h3>
    <p>
      Lenses form images by refraction.
      Convex lenses converge light, while concave lenses diverge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lens formula and magnification equations allow prediction
      of image position and size for any object placement.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="optical-instruments">
    <h3>Optical Instruments</h3>
    <p>
      Optical instruments like microscopes, telescopes, and cameras
      use combinations of lenses and mirrors to manipulate light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding geometrical optics is essential for analyzing
      how these instruments magnify, focus, and form images.
