    <h1>Relativity</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      Relativity completely rewrites how space, time, motion, mass, and gravity work.
      It shows that time is not universal, space is not fixed, simultaneity is not absolute,
      and gravity is not a force in the traditional sense.
      This theory does not feel intuitive because the universe was not built for human intuition.

<div id="classical-failure">
  <h3>Why Classical Physics Failed</h3>
  <p>
    Classical physics assumed space and time were absolute. One universal clock.
    One fixed stage where events happen. Motion was relative, but time and space
    themselves were not questioned.
  </p>
  <p>
    This worldview worked well until light entered the picture. Maxwell’s equations
    predicted that electromagnetic waves travel at a fixed speed. This speed did not
    depend on the motion of the source or observer.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to classical logic, speeds should add. If you move toward a light beam,
    you should measure a higher speed. Experiments repeatedly showed this never happens.
    Light always travels at the same speed in vacuum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Attempts to save classical physics using ideas like the luminiferous ether failed.
    The universe refused to cooperate. Something fundamental had to change.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="postulates">
  <h3>Postulates of Special Relativity</h3>
  <p>
    Special relativity is built on two simple postulates. Simple to state. Brutal to accept.
  </p>
  <p>
    First: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
    No frame is special. No preferred observer exists.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second: the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers,
    regardless of their motion or the motion of the source.
  </p>
  <p>
    These two statements force space and time to change instead of light.
    The universe preserves light speed by stretching time and space themselves.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="simultaneity">
  <h3>Relativity of Simultaneity</h3>
  <p>
    Events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another.
    There is no universal “now” shared across the universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    This happens because observers moving relative to each other disagree on time measurements.
    Light signals used to synchronize clocks arrive differently depending on motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simultaneity is not broken due to delay or perception.
    It is fundamentally frame dependent.
  </p>
  <p>
    This destroys the idea of absolute time and replaces it with observer dependent time.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="time-dilation">
  <h3>Time Dilation</h3>
  <p>
    Moving clocks run slower compared to stationary ones.
    This effect is not mechanical or due to malfunction.
    Time itself flows differently for moving observers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The faster an object moves, the slower its time progresses relative to a stationary observer.
    At everyday speeds this effect is negligible. Near the speed of light it becomes dramatic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time dilation has been confirmed using atomic clocks on airplanes and satellites.
    Without correcting for it, GPS systems would fail within minutes.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="length-contraction">
  <h3>Length Contraction</h3>
  <p>
    Objects moving relative to an observer appear shorter along the direction of motion.
    This is called length contraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    The object does not feel compressed. In its own rest frame, its length remains unchanged.
    Length contraction occurs only from the perspective of an external observer.
  </p>
  <p>
    This effect ensures consistency between space and time transformations
    and preserves the constancy of light speed.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="mass-energy">
  <h3>Mass–Energy Equivalence</h3>
  <p>
    Mass and energy are not separate entities. They are different forms of the same thing.
    This relationship is expressed by E = mc².
  </p>
  <p>
    The equation does not mean mass turns into energy during motion.
    It means mass itself is energy at rest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nuclear reactions release enormous energy because small amounts of mass
    are converted into energy.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="spacetime">
  <h3>Spacetime</h3>
  <p>
    Space and time are not independent.
    They form a single four dimensional structure called spacetime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Events are described by both spatial coordinates and time coordinates.
    Different observers slice spacetime differently depending on their motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spacetime replaces the idea of space as a container and time as a clock.
    They are part of the same geometric object.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="gravity">
  <h3>Gravity as Curved Spacetime</h3>
  <p>
    General relativity redefines gravity.
    It is not a force pulling objects together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mass and energy curve spacetime.
    Objects move along the straightest possible paths in this curved geometry.
    These paths appear as gravitational attraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    This explains phenomena classical gravity could not,
    such as gravitational time dilation and the bending of light near massive objects.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="evidence">
  <h3>Experimental Evidence</h3>
  <p>
    Relativity has been confirmed repeatedly.
    Time dilation is measured daily by GPS satellites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Light bending around massive bodies has been observed during eclipses.
    Gravitational waves predicted by general relativity have been detected directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Relativity is not philosophical.
    It is experimentally verified reality.
  </p>
