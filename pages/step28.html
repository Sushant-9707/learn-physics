    <h1>Wave Optics</h1>

    <p class="summary">
      Wave optics studies light as a wave phenomenon rather than a collection of rays.
      It explains effects that geometrical optics cannot, such as interference,
      diffraction, and polarization. These phenomena reveal that light spreads,
      overlaps, and interacts with itself in ways only waves can.

  <div id="limits-ray">
    <h3>Limits of Geometrical Optics</h3>
    <p>
      Geometrical optics treats light as straight-line rays and works well
      when objects are much larger than the wavelength of light.
      However, it completely fails to explain why light bends around edges
      or produces patterns when passing through narrow openings.
    </p>
    <p>
      These failures force us to abandon the ray model and accept
      that light behaves as a wave under many circumstances.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="huygens">
    <h3>Huygens’ Principle</h3>
    <p>
      Huygens’ principle states that every point on a wavefront acts as a source
      of secondary wavelets, and the new wavefront is the envelope of these wavelets.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea provides a powerful way to understand reflection, refraction,
      and diffraction without relying on ray assumptions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="interference">
    <h3>Interference of Light</h3>
    <p>
      Interference occurs when two or more light waves overlap
      and combine according to the principle of superposition.
      Depending on their relative phase, the waves can reinforce
      or cancel each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads to alternating bright and dark regions,
      proving that light has a wave nature.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="young">
    <h3>Young’s Double Slit Experiment</h3>
    <p>
      Young’s experiment demonstrated interference by passing light
      through two closely spaced slits.
      The resulting pattern of bright and dark fringes
      cannot be explained by particle or ray models.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiment is one of the strongest classical proofs
      that light behaves as a wave.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="diffraction">
    <h3>Diffraction of Light</h3>
    <p>
      Diffraction is the bending and spreading of light
      when it passes through a narrow opening or around an obstacle.
      It becomes significant when the size of the opening
      is comparable to the wavelength of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diffraction shows that light does not travel strictly in straight lines.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="single-slit">
    <h3>Single Slit Diffraction</h3>
    <p>
      In single slit diffraction, light spreads out after passing through a narrow slit,
      producing a central bright maximum surrounded by weaker fringes.
      The pattern arises from interference between wavelets across the slit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This phenomenon sets a fundamental limit on optical resolution.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="polarization">
    <h3>Polarization</h3>
    <p>
      Polarization refers to restricting the direction of oscillation
      of the electric field in a light wave.
      Only transverse waves can be polarized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of polarization confirms that light is a transverse wave.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="coherence">
    <h3>Coherence of Light</h3>
    <p>
      Coherence describes the ability of light waves to produce stable interference patterns.
      For sustained interference, the waves must maintain a constant phase difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lasers are highly coherent sources, which is why they are central to wave optics experiments.
